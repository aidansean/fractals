Fixed point fractals take the transformation:
z -> f(z)
and iterate until convergence.

For some reason there don't appear to be many examples of these fractals online at all.  I tried a few fractals and some look quite boring (eg tan(z)) although some pretty regions could be hiding in the areas that don't converge quickly.  Sample images use palette 9, which is sensitive to all numbers of steps.

Interestingly z -> exp(z) converges, but z -> log(z) does not.  z -> sin(z) has a pole at (0,0) which looks like it could be very interesting, but so far I have not dedicated much time to exploring it.  Doing so would require a very rich palette.
